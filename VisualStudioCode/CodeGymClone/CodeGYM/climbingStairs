        dynamic programming problem
        n = 5 

        From 5, there is only one way to reach to the top. 
        It will be 1.
        Then,
        From 4, there is also only one way to reach 5 because if you add 2, then it will be exeed the number.

        Then,
        from 3, there will be 2 ways to reach to 5. 11 and 2

        Then,
        from 2, there will be 3 ways to reach to 5. 111, 12,21 

        you can see the pattern here.
        it is exactly same as fibonnaci pattern.

                8  5  3  2  1  1
        
        we will make two variables. one and two 

        initially, they will be 1.
        as the for loop goes it will keep adding the two previous numbers
